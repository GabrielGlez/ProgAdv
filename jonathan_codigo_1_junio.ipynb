       " 'The New Frontiers of Trek... really new?: The thing to remember about Peter David is that he thrives on recurring characters. Those characters which he has made up before (Stone, \"Rock and a Hard Place;\" Delcara, \"Vendetta;\" etc) function by sounding off of the great characterization he gives to the already known cast. That is David\\'s strength and I feel that \"New Frontier\" is an experimental place for him. Not the great read that \"Imzadi\" or \"Q-Squared\" was but better than most Trek novels. Enjoyable read. I agree wit everyone else, however, in saying that Pocket Books should have released the entire thing together instead of this \"to be continued\" garbage\\r']"
